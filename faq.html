  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Where should I stay?</h2>
    <p class="section-description">
      We recommend that you get a hotel near Warsaw's city center or closer to the city of Józefów. If you need to be close to the venue, then you can also look for a hotel in the city of Marki, but options are more limited.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Will there be transportation to/from the party?</h2>
    <p class="section-description">
      We are working on it and will add more details in the near future.

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">What should I wear?</h2>
    <p class="section-description">
      Wear what makes you feel most comfortable (except for a white dress). We suggest long or short dresses for women and suits for men. August is a hot month in Warsaw, and relatively dry, so wear something breathable.
