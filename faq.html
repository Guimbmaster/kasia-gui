    <h2 class="section-title">Where should I stay?</h2>
    <p class="section-description">
      We recommend that you get a hotel near Warsaw's city center (or north of Warsaw city center). If you need to be closer to the venue, then you can also look for a hotel in the city of Marki, but options are more limited.

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Will there be transportation to/from the party?</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">What should I wear</h2>
    <p class="section-description">
      Wear what makes you feel most comfortable (except for a white dress). We suggest long or short dresses for women and suits for men. August is a hot month in Warsaw, and relatively dry, so wear something breathable.
